# Halo3-H2A-Tags

Provided AS-IS for use with the halo 3 editing kit. Drop the h2a folder in your tags directory and copy the globals tags from tags\h2a\globals and tags\h2a\ui\chud to your regular tags\globals and tags\ui\chud locations.

If you want to run a map like Coagulation, you must go in to the scenarios folder and unzip the lightmap bitmap, probestore, and scenario_faux_data zips into the same folder.
